Important Notes:
1. Intros and outros with exactly the same bit-length might cause unexpected behaviour
Solution: In case you happen to experience unexpected behaviour with a newly added intro/outro
please leave 0.001 or more secs of empty sound before or after the actual sound in your editor(premiere, vegas.. etc.)
2. Folders get re-read at midnight so its optimal to add your files after school day.
In case you forget please press space in the Console window after updating your files.
3. You can hover upon the I-icon in the editor to reveal important in-app details.
4. In order for the microphone dimmer to work properly please:
disable all unused microphones in the windows audio devices menu
the program is originally mean to be used with the Wo Mic app.
This casts microphone input from a telephone to a PC.
(package installer should be included somwhere in the program)
5. randlist.txt should be maintained in case Randomize NF Files is used.
(see the file on how it works)
